# [RynBot](https://github.com/LaughLax/RynBot) (Python)

I created and maintained **RynBot** (link to be added), a bot application for Discord using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library. Its features included:

- Modular design for updates to be deployed without downtime
- **MySQL** database for persistent data storage
- Database structure deployed using [Alembic](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/)
- **Redis** cache to reduce calls to database
- Multithreading and multiprocessing to offload CPU-intensive tasks and keep application responsive
- Self-hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 running **Debian** Linux

Here are a couple other things I learned about while building it:

- How to use and create decorator functions.
- How to use `async` and `await`. I also built a decorator to convert synchronous database calls into asynchronous functions.

# [Advent of Code](https://github.com/LaughLax/Advent-of-Code) (Python)

Since 2018, I've participated in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) event run by Eric Wastl. AoC is a set of 25 two-part coding challenges, presented one per day December 1 through Christmas. In 2019 and 2020, I was among the **first 1,000 people** to complete many of the challenges. Several times, I was among the first 100. My completion time and rank for each problem can be viewed at the repository.

Here are some skills I used, improved, or learned while completing these problems:

- Selecting the right **data structures** for the problem, such as maps, linked lists, or trees.
- Preparing a project environment for rapid development and testing

# [Icarus](https://github.com/gaiwecoor/icarus4) (JavaScript)

I am an active contributor to **Icarus**, another bot application for Discord. Icarus uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library. With the recent release of discord.js v13, we're currently working to migrate Icarus to its next major version ([v5](https://github.com/gaiwecoor/icarus5)). Features I contributed to or revised include:

Here are a couple other things I learned about while building it:

- Collaborative **Git** workflow tasks such as forking, feature branches, and code review through pull requests.

# [EIA-930-charts](https://github.com/LaughLax/EIA-930-charts) (Python)

I made this collection of scripts to make charts (both interactive and static) from a particular public dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

(include example charts here)
