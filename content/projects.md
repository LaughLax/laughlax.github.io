# RynBot

I created and maintained **RynBot**, a bot application for Discord in **Python** using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library. Its features included:

- Modular design that allows updates to be deployed without downtime
- **MySQL** database for persistent data storage
- **Redis** cache to reduce calls to database
- Multithreading and multiprocessing so application responds even while working on CPU-intensive tasks

Here are a few things I learned about while building it:

- How to use and create decorator functions.
- How to use `async` and `await`. Beyond just learning what these are and when they're required, I also built a decorator to convert a synchronous database call into an asynchronous function.

# Icarus

I am an active contributor to [**Icarus**](https://github.com/gaiwecoor/icarus4), another bot application for Discord; Icarus is written in **JavaScript** and uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library. With the recent release of discord.js v13, we're currently working to migrate Icarus to its next major version ([v5](https://github.com/gaiwecoor/icarus5)).
