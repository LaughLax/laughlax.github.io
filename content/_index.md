# Who I Am

If you're reading this, you've probably seen my resume already. Let me tell you a bit more.

**I am:**
- **Dedicated** to continuous learning.
- Skilled at **finding connections** between ideas.
- A strong **analytical** thinker.
- Naturally drawn to **[solving problems](https://xkcd.com/356/)**.

# What Motivates Me

**Climate change** is not just some distant possibility; [it's already here](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/) and it affects every aspect of our lives. We can and must decarbonize our economy to prevent worse impacts. There are many obstacles to success, but we can overcome them and build a better world for the next generations.

**Electricity** is a central part of modern life. The electric grid faces a particular set of challenges as we shift from fossil-fueled power generation to low- and zero-carbon sources of energy. Some of those challenges are well-publicized (such as resource adequacy challenges) while others are mostly discussed among technical experts and policy wonks.

I aim to work at the **intersection** of these two spaces. If it helps keep the lights on and enables decarbonization, count me in!

# My Work
